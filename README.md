# Welcome to Open 3p

This is the Open 3P project repository. It contains all the schemas, controlled lists and additional information to publish standard.open3p.org. For the site itself, please see [standard.open3p.org](https://standard.open3p.org/) instead. 

The site is build with [![Built with Material for MkDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Material_for_MkDocs-526CFE?style=for-the-badge&logo=MaterialForMkDocs&logoColor=white)](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) from this repository.

## What is Open 3P?

Open 3P is the open standard for packaging data. The project to create the standard started June 2021 and contained project partners:

- Open Data Manchester
- OPRL
- Ecosurety
- RECOUP
- Dsposal

v1.0 of the standard was released August 2022 with a focus on plastic packaging within the United Kingdom geography.
v2.0 was released June 2023 and incorported all materials types with the United Kingdom geography.
Work is currently in development to incorporate other geographies with aims to becoming the global standard for packaging data.

## Improvementing schemas

We are always interested in practical suggestions for improvements to Open 3P, and our collection of schemas has been growing gradually since it's initital launch in 2021.

Open 3P is designed to be a practical and user-friendly solution. We acknowledge that it's impossible to capture every nuance of packaging specifications. Our goal is to provide a simplified yet effective framework.

## A Simplified Approach

We recognise that packaging details can be intricate. In the spirit of simplicity and user-friendliness, Open 3P intentionally focuses on key elements for exchanging data through the supply chain. While it might seem feasible to include more granular details, we believe in keeping the standard straightforward for the benefit of data capture, exchange and analysis.

## User-Centric Philosophy

Our commitment is to create a standard that is easy to understand and use. This means making choices that prioritise simplicity over exhaustive complexity. We aim to strike a balance that serves the needs of manufacturers, retailers, compliance schemes and all stakeholders involved.

In essence, Open 3P is a practical solution that acknowledges the complexity of packaging specifications while ensuring a straightforward and usable exchange standard for the community.
