## Improvementing schemas

We are always interested in practical suggestions for improvements to OSTFD.

OSTFD is designed to be a practical and user-friendly solution. We acknowledge that it's impossible to capture every nuance of textiles and fashion specifications. Our goal is to provide a simplified yet effective framework.

## A Simplified Approach

We recognise that textiles and fashion details can be intricate. In the spirit of simplicity and user-friendliness, OSTFD intentionally focuses on key elements for exchanging data through the supply chain. While it might seem feasible to include more granular details, we believe in keeping the standard straightforward for the benefit of data capture, exchange and analysis.

## User-Centric Philosophy

Our commitment is to create a standard that is easy to understand and use. This means making choices that prioritise simplicity over exhaustive complexity. We aim to strike a balance that serves the needs of manufacturers, retailers, compliance schemes and all stakeholders involved.

In essence, OSTFD is a practical solution that acknowledges the complexity of textiles and fashion specifications while ensuring a straightforward and usable exchange standard for the community.
