The goal of Open 3P is to establish a common language for exchanging and sharing data related to packaging materials and processes, which will help to improve transparency and accountability in the industry. With Open 3P, stakeholders in the packaging supply chain will be able to share information about materials, components and packaging in a standardised format. This will allow for better collaboration between manufacturers, retailers, recyclers, regulators, and consumers. By creating a common understanding of the materials and processes involved in packaging, it will be easier to identify opportunities for reducing waste, increasing efficiency, and improving sustainability throughout the supply chain. The first phase of the project brought together stakeholders from the entire packaging ecosystem to explore how we might create the foundations for systemic change in the packaging value chain. We had more than 120 individuals from over 70 organisations take part in our workshops, interviews and research and we are incredibly grateful to them for sharing their time, expertise and support. Open 3P is based on the principles of open data, which means that it is freely accessible, sharable, and usable by anyone. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts and use cases, so that it can evolve over time as new technologies and practices emerge. The development of Open 3P is guided by the OpenStand principles of: Due process Broad consensus Transparency Balance Openness which ensure that the standard is developed in a fair and inclusive manner, and that all stakeholders have a voice in the process. Overall, Open 3P represents an important step forward for the packaging industry, as it provides a foundation for greater transparency and collaboration across the supply chain. By adopting a common language for sharing and exchanging data, stakeholders will be able to work together more effectively to reduce waste, improve sustainability, and create a more circular economy. What is an open data standard? \u00b6 An open data standard is a set of guidelines that dictate the structure and composition of data. It enables people and organisations to communicate data about the same topic using the same language. Standardisation of data structure ensures consistency, comparability and interconnectivity. Open data standards are publicly accessible and can be used by anyone. This makes it easy to understand, share, and reuse data that has been published and shared by others. As a result of open data standards, multiple organisations can collaborate and create a larger and more comprehensive dataset when they publish data about the same topic. By adhering to a set of open standards, data can be shared more efficiently, allowing for greater collaboration, analysis and discovery. How is the standard being developed? \u00b6 The initial standard development was funded by Innovate UK , and is being developed through workshops with industry experts over a number of iterations. The project patners were OPRL Open Data Manchester, Dsposal, RECOUP, and Ecosurety. How to use the standard \u00b6 To use the Open 3P standard, start by familiarising yourself with the terms and definitions outlined in the standard. These are used to describe the structure and components of packaging and the packaging supply chain. Next, map your data to the standard by using the terms and definitions as a guide. This will ensure that your data is consistent and can be easily shared and understood by others who are also using the standard. It\u2019s important to note that the Open 3P standard is not a technology or platform, but rather a set of rules and guidelines for how to structure data related to packaging. It is used to help people create technology, applications, and integrations that can work together to improve transparency and sustainability in the packaging industry. By using the Open 3P standard, you can ensure that your data is accurate, consistent, and interoperable with other systems that also use the standard.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1_Start_Here/1_1_Introduction/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1_Start_Here/1_1_Introduction/#what-is-open-3p","text":"Open 3P is an open standard for packaging data for the packaging industry, which is being developed by Open Data Manchester in collaboration with over 120 individuals from 70 organisations across the packaging supply chain.

This tells the story of how wine bottles are created with a packaging manufacturer, how that packaging manufacturer sends their packaging to a packer/filler and then how that packer/filler will put packaging together, filled with a product and then send them to a retailer. The eight flow diagrams below compliment each other to build a complete picture. Shared responsiblity When viewing the flows below be aware that no single individual and/or organisation is responsible for the entire data capture. It is the intent of Open 3P that experts in their part of the value chain are repsonsible for it\u2019s adherence to the data. The flow \u00b6 Open 3P has been designed to allow information to flow from base materials all the way through to a load. Below you can see how these are connected. flowchart LR subgraph baseMaterials[Base Materials] bm_example[base material] end subgraph materials[Materials] ma_example[material] end subgraph components[Components] co_example[component] end subgraph completePackages[Complete Packages] cp_example[complete package] end subgraph loads[Loads] lo_example[load] end bm_example --> ma_example ma_example --> co_example co_example --> cp_example cp_example --> lo_example Introducing basic items \u00b6 At its most basic Open 3P allows the minimal amount of infomation to be passed along. In this example cardboard is used as the base material and then again as the material. At the component step the cardboard box is combined with tape to create a complete package ready to be filled by a product before being sent out on a load. flowchart LR subgraph baseMaterials[Base Materials] bm_cardboard[cardboard] end subgraph materials[Materials] ma_cardboard[cardboard] end subgraph components[Components] co_cardboard[cardboard box] co_example[tape] end subgraph completePackages[Complete Packages] cp_example[complete package] end bm_cardboard --> ma_cardboard ma_cardboard --> co_cardboard co_cardboard --> cp_example co_example --> cp_example Combining items to make complex items \u00b6 Although some items used within the packaging value chains are simple, others are complex. Open 3P allows the combination of items at each schema level. In the example below a packaging tape is created by the combination of cellulose and adhesive.

measurements should be given using the metric system. Weight: grams (g) Area Density: grams per square metre (gsm) or square metres per kilogram (m^2/kg) Numbers should be entered with a decimal place. Use the decimal / full stop / period character as a separator. Do not exceed 3 decimal places. When rounding, use convential rounding methods: for 5 and above round up, 4 and below round down. For example: volume = 0.67952 rounded to 0.68. Important : When converting between systems of measurement, perform the conversion first and then apply the convential rounding. This will give more accuracy and consistency.","title":"Materials"},{"location":"3_Data_Specification/3_2_Materials/#materials","text":"The materials schema contains information regarding the materials that are used within components.

Height: millimetre (mm) Width: millimetre (mm) Length: millimetre (mm) Volume: cubic metre (m3) Weight: grams (g) Weight Tolerance: percent (%) Numbers should be entered with a decimal place. Use the decimal / full stop / period character as a separator. Do not exceed 3 decimal places. When rounding, use convential rounding methods: for 5 and above round up, 4 and below round down. For example: volume = 0.67952 rounded to 0.68. Important : When converting between systems of measurement, perform the conversion first and then apply the convential rounding. This will give more accuracy and consistency. Default Front of a component \u00b6 Prior caputuring measurements, first determine the default front of the component, this is similar to GS1 (Note: GS1 rules are specified only for complete packaging and not components. Therefore, there are subtle differences to convert from taking a measurement for the complete packaging versus a component). In this standard, as with GS1 , the default front is the face with the largest surface area, where area is equal to the width times the height . Important : Determining of default front provides a consistent, repeatable process to find measurements for a given component. Figure 1: An example for finding the default front of a component. The default front is the face of the with the largest area (Area = width X height ) Some components have the same surface area, thus more than one possible front. These components can be presented both vertically and horizontally. If a component has more than one possible front, the highest side is considered to be the default front. Note : Calculating the area for a rectangular component is simple. However, for non-rectangular components (for example, components with a cylindrical or irregular form), the method to calculate the area is: First break the component into multiple sides. Then, for: a round component: do not use (=pi*r^2) to calculate the area. Instead, draw \u201ctwo dimensional\u201d rectangles around the round component\u2019s sides and then calculate the area for each side. any other shape component: draw a \u201ctwo dimensional\u201d rectangle around the sides of the component, and then calculate the area for each side. The side with the maximum area then becomes the default front of that component. Figure 2: An example for finding the default front of an irregular shaped component. After drawing rectangles around the component, the default front is the face of the with the largest surface area (Area = width X height ) Measuring the height, width, and depth of a component \u00b6 After the default front has been determined, as with GS1 , it is possible to determine the height, width, and depth of a component. For rectangular components: Height: from the base to the top Width: from the left to the right Depth: from the front to the back Figure 3: Example of measuring the height, width, and depth for a rectangular component. Note: If there are two different measurements for the height, width, or depth, always report the maximum measurement. Figure 4: Example of reporting the maximum width, when there are two different size widths. Here, the width reported would be 12 mm because it is larger than the 8 mm. Additionally, there are two different sized depths. Here, the 9 mm depth would be reported because it is larger than the 5 mm depth. For irregular shaped components: Similar to finding the default front of an irregularly shaped component, draw a \u201cthree dimensional\u201d rectangle around the component. Height: from the base to the top Width: from the left to the right Depth: from the front to the back For unformed, flexible components: Take the measurements as if the component was fully formed and filled. For standing components: Height: from the flat surface to the top most point Width: from the left-most point to the right-most point Depth: from the default front to the farthest opposite surface For components with leaning or irregular verticlas: Height: from the flat surface to the top most point (parallel to the vertex) Width: from the left most point to the right most point Depth: from the default front to the farthest opposite surface For components that are cylindrical: For cylindrical items two dimensions will be nominally equal. Which dimensions are equal is determined by the result of determination of the default front. Guide for component images \u00b6 As with providing measurements, please first find the default front of the component. The image capturing process and naming convention is similar to GS1 . As with measurements, we altered the gs1 standard for capturing the component. Type of Image \u00b6 For the purposes of this standard, we define the differences between photographic and rendered images. Note: both types are accepted but the naming convention will differ based on image type so that images have unique names and do not having naming conflicts. Photographic image : the result of the electronic or chemical capture of a likeness of a physical object with the use of a camera. Rendered image : the result of the creation of a digital likeness of a physical object with the use of a computer and software. Image Recommendations \u00b6 Provide coloured images. However, do not provide colour casts. Colour should be as rich, vibrant and eye-catching as possible Contrast and exposure should be balanced; avoid high contrast effects and \u201cblown-out\u201d highlights Images should not be overly sharpened Components should be centred in Margins to cover 95% on the canvas. Graphic rendering of a component should be realistic. Do not provide layers, guides or rulers in the images. Background layer should be white (RGB 255,255,255). Remove signatures, \u201cfinger printing\u201d or visible watermarks. No compression artifacts. No interpolation (\u201cresizing up\u201d). File size \u00b6 900x900 to 2400x2400 pixels Component faces \u00b6 After determining the default front, the possible faces, in relation to the default front, are: 1. Default Front 2. Left 3. Top 7. Back 8. Right 9. Bottom Naming convention for URL \u00b6 Please follow this naming convention: - component identifier - underscore _ - type of image ( photographic or rendered ) - underscore _ - component face ( 1 : Default front, 2 : Left, 3 : Top, 7 : Back, 8 : Right, 9 : Bottom) - orientation ( C : Centre, L : left, R : right, N : No plunge angle) Example : An image for a component that is rendered with a default front facing image and centred orientation. identifier123_rendered_1C.jpg","title":"Components"},{"location":"3_Data_Specification/3_3_Components/#components","text":"The components schema contains information regarding the individual components that are used to create complete packages.

This is because each term in the list has a standardised definition and value, which allows for more precise comparisons between materials, packages and loads. Overall, controlled lists play a vital role in ensuring that data is reliable and can be easily analyzed, leading to more informed decision-making and better outcomes for all stakeholders in the packaging industry.

It is a Community Interest Company (CIC) that has an \u2018asset lock\u2019, a legal mechanism that prevents predatory take over of its assets by third parties. ODM\u2019s role as the DSHB is four-fold. It holds the standard in an asset-lock. It develops and maintains the standard on behalf of the Standard Custodian Board (SCB). It provides secretariat services to the SCB. It provides support services to individuals and organisations that want to adopt and exploit the potential of the data standard. The SCB ensures that the standard is developed for and on-behalf of the packaging value chain. The board consists of industry stakeholders, domain and technical experts and is chaired by ODM. The board is elected through an open process with board members holding post for a maximum of three continuous years before stepping down. Development of the standard follows a strict governance process where changes are either submitted to the board through the DSHB, the SCB itself or through external petition. Changes are assessed and if deemed to be beneficial are circulated for consultation. After the consultation period expires, the changes are then re-assessed and adopted if agreed. The SCB then mandates the DSHB to implement the change. All proceedings and documents relating to the governance arrangements of the Open 3P standard can be found on the Governance Proceedings page of the Open 3P website. Meetings are quarterly with agenda, related documents circulated to the board 30 days before the meeting.","title":"Governance"},{"location":"8_Governance/8_1_Governance/#governance","text":"The Open 3P data standard has been developed to answer the data needs of the packaging industry.
