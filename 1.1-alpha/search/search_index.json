It has been developed as part of the Plastics Packaging Portals (PPP) Project, an Innovate UK supported project under the Smart Sustainable Plastic Packaging (SSPP) Fund. The first phase of the project was led by OPRL alongside project partners Open Data Manchester, Dsposal, RECOUP, and Ecosurety. The first phase of the project brought together stakeholders from the entire packaging ecosystem to explore how we might create the foundations for systemic change in the packaging value chain. We had more than 80 individuals from over 40 organisations take part in our workshops, interviews and research and we are incredibly grateful to them for sharing their time, expertise and support. PPP Phase One had 5 main aims which were all delivered on the 30th November 2022: Extend the Open3R Household Waste Recycling Centre (HWRCs) data standard Develop a prototype portal to capture data on geographically located recycling services such as HWRCs, bring banks, instore take back schemes to support a comprehensive open database of this information Develop an open standard for plastic packaging data (Open 3P) Develop a prototype portal to capture packaging attribute data to enable it to be shared along the plastic packaging value chain and reported on Determine a sustainable business model and governance structure The first round of funding and phase one of the project was focussed on plastic packaging. Innovate UK has direct awarded additional funded to develop Open 3P to include all packaging materials not just plastic. Phase two of the project started on the 1st December 2022. The second phase of the project is led by Dsposal alongside project partners Open Data Manchester, OPRL, RECOUP, and Ecosurety. By improving the data quality, granularity and availability of both packaging data and recycling services data and by enabling these datasets to be linked we believe we can support more sustainable packaging choices. By giving stakeholders visibility of the different parts of the chain we can help designers and manufacturers consider the end-of-life implications of their choices and we can help them determine the difference between a material being technically recyclable and the practicality of it being recycled. Providing recyclers and reprocessors with detailed data about material types and recycling disruptors we can enable more materials to be kept at a higher value for longer. Improving these datasets also helps deliver better information into the hands of consumers to support them to recycle more. Better data on market trends in packaging can also provide more certainty and unlock investment and innovation so that we can increase our recycling infrastructure and ensure more of our waste packaging ends up recycled. The standard is being developed according to the OpenStand principles of: Due process Broad consensus Transparency Balance Openness What is an open data standard? \u00b6 An open data standard is a set of rules that describe the structure and components of a dataset. Putting rules in place means people and organisations that publish and share data about the same thing can use the same language to talk about it. Having a standard makes it a lot easier to understand and reuse data that has been published and shared. It is especially useful if data is being published and shared by lots of different organisations to make an even bigger dataset. Anyone can then read about the standard, contribute data, or use the data knowing everyone is talking about the same thing. How is the standard being developed? \u00b6 The initial standard development was funded by Innovate UK , and is being developed through workshops with industry experts over a number of iterations. How to use the standard \u00b6 The documentation here details how to publish data to the standard, and how to use data that has been published to the standard. At this stage, the expectation is that data management will be supported by additional applications (such as the packaging portal that is also being developed as part of this project), and it is possible to record and publish data to the standard using the provided csv files in Section 7 of this documentation.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1_Start_Here/1_1_Introduction/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1_Start_Here/1_1_Introduction/#what-is-the-open-3p","text":"Open 3P is an open data standard for packaging.

This tells the story of how water bottles are created with a packaging manufacturer, how that packaging manufacturer sends their packaging to a packer/filler (Figure 1), and then how that packer/filler will put packaging together, filled with a product and then send them to a retailer (Figure 2). In both figures: - black represents the component catalogue items used to create complete packaging - orange represents the complete packaging items used to create multipacks - green represents the component catalogue, multipack, or complete packaging items used to create the load catalogue item - yellow represents the load catalogue item made to create a load Figure 1: From a packaging manufacturer to a packer/filler Above in Figure 1, we show the creation of water bottle components. After creating the water bottle components (the plastic bottle, two different types of lids, and a label), a packaging manufacturer would then use boxes (in this diagram it is one box size with the same materials) and a pallet to send their water bottle components to a packer/filler. The water bottle components, placed in the boxes on a pallet would create a load catalogue. This load catalogue would then be used to send to a specific packer/filler during a specific time period. The use of the component catalogue and load catalogue simplifies data entry by pulling data that has already been entered. Only the load would need to be updated based on reporting periods to estimate how many times a specific packer/filler recieved the load catalogue. Another packaging manufacturer would then separately create the plastic rings and use boxes and a pallet that they consistently send to the specific packer/filler. They would also update how many times during a certain time period that they sent these plastic rings to the (single) packer/filler. According to this image, these plastic rings use the same boxes and pallet (sizes and materials) to create the load catalogue for sending the packaging items to the packer/filler. As with the water bottle packaging manufacturer, the load would be updated based on reporting periods to gain an estimate of how much plastic rings are being sent to an area. Figure 2: From a packer/filler to a retailer Instead of re-entering data, a packer/filler would pull the data from the packaging manufacturer for the water bottle components. Using the component catalogue, the packer/filler could create two different types of water bottles (with the two different kinds of lids). The packer/filler uses the components to create the two different complete packaging, sealed bottles with lids, which is filled with the product (in this case, water). Notice that even though the plastic ring is alone in complete packaging. The reason for this is to fill in data related to this component, even though alone. For instance, the level of packaging (primary, secondary, shipment, transit) relies on how the complete packaging is filled and used, which is contained in the complete packaging csv. In addition to creating single purchase water bottle items, the packer/filler can use the same created water bottles, along with the plastic ring to create a multipack. Notice how the first type of lid is used solely for creating a multipack, and the second type of lid is used to create an individual unit. The individual use bottles along with the multipack can be combined onto a mixed pallet with boxes to create a load catalogue. As with the packaging manufacturer, the packer/filler can use the commonly created load catalogue items to send to multiple retail stores. They would then update how many times they sent the load to the retailer during certain reporting periods.","title":"Data Flow"},{"location":"1_Start_Here/1_3_Data_Flow/#data-flow","text":"Here, we show two examples of how data could flow using the open standard.

Height: millimetre (mm) Width: millimetre (mm) Length: millimetre (mm) Volume: cubic metre (m3) Weight: grams (g) Weight Tolerance: percent (%) Numbers should be entered with a decimal place. Use the decimal / full stop / period character as a separator. Do not exceed 3 decimal places. When rounding, use convential rounding methods: for 5 and above round up, 4 and below round down. For example: volume = 0.67952 rounded to 0.68. Important : When converting between systems of measurement, perform the conversion first and then apply the convential rounding. This will give more accuracy and consistency. Default Front of a component \u00b6 Prior caputuring measurements, first determine the default front of the component, this is similar to GS1 (Note: GS1 rules are specified only for complete packaging and not components. Therefore, there are subtle differences to convert from taking a measurement for the complete packaging versus a component). In this standard, as with GS1 , the default front is the face with the largest surface area, where area is equal to the width times the height . Important : Determining of default front provides a consistent, repeatable process to find measurements for a given component. Figure 1: An example for finding the default front of a component. The default front is the face of the with the largest area (Area = width X height ) Some components have the same surface area, thus more than one possible front. These components can be presented both vertically and horizontally. If a component has more than one possible front, the highest side is considered to be the default front. Note : Calculating the area for a rectangular component is simple. However, for non-rectangular components (for example, components with a cylindrical or irregular form), the method to calculate the area is: First break the component into multiple sides. Then, for: a round component: do not use (=pi*r^2) to calculate the area. Instead, draw \u201ctwo dimensional\u201d rectangles around the round component\u2019s sides and then calculate the area for each side. any other shape component: draw a \u201ctwo dimensional\u201d rectangle around the sides of the component, and then calculate the area for each side. The side with the maximum area then becomes the default front of that component. Figure 2: An example for finding the default front of an irregular shaped component. After drawing rectangles around the component, the default front is the face of the with the largest surface area (Area = width X height ) Measuring the height, width, and depth of a component \u00b6 After the default front has been determined, as with GS1 , it is possible to determine the height, width, and depth of a component. For rectangular components: Height: from the base to the top Width: from the left to the right Depth: from the front to the back Figure 3: Example of measuring the height, width, and depth for a rectangular component. Note: If there are two different measurements for the height, width, or depth, always report the maximum measurement. Figure 4: Example of reporting the maximum width, when there are two different size widths. Here, the width reported would be 12 mm because it is larger than the 8 mm. Additionally, there are two different sized depths. Here, the 9 mm depth would be reported because it is larger than the 5 mm depth. For irregular shaped components: Similar to finding the default front of an irregularly shaped component, draw a \u201cthree dimensional\u201d rectangle around the component. Height: from the base to the top Width: from the left to the right Depth: from the front to the back For unformed, flexible components: Take the measurements as if the component was fully formed and filled. For standing components: Height: from the flat surface to the top most point Width: from the left-most point to the right-most point Depth: from the default front to the farthest opposite surface For components with leaning or irregular verticlas: Height: from the flat surface to the top most point (parallel to the vertex) Width: from the left most point to the right most point Depth: from the default front to the farthest opposite surface For components that are cylindrical: For cylindrical items two dimensions will be nominally equal. Which dimensions are equal is determined by the result of determination of the default front. Guide for component images \u00b6 As with providing measurements, please first find the default front of the component. The image capturing process and naming convention is similar to GS1 . As with measurements, we altered the gs1 standard for capturing the component. Type of Image \u00b6 For the purposes of this standard, we define the differences between photographic and rendered images. Note: both types are accepted but the naming convention will differ based on image type so that images have unique names and do not having naming conflicts. Photographic image : the result of the electronic or chemical capture of a likeness of a physical object with the use of a camera. Rendered image : the result of the creation of a digital likeness of a physical object with the use of a computer and software. Image Recommendations \u00b6 Provide coloured images. However, do not provide colour casts. Colour should be as rich, vibrant and eye-catching as possible Contrast and exposure should be balanced; avoid high contrast effects and \u201cblown-out\u201d highlights Images should not be overly sharpened Components should be centred in Margins to cover 95% on the canvas. Graphic rendering of a component should be realistic. Do not provide layers, guides or rulers in the images. Background layer should be white (RGB 255,255,255). Remove signatures, \u201cfinger printing\u201d or visible watermarks. No compression artifacts. No interpolation (\u201cresizing up\u201d). File size \u00b6 900x900 to 2400x2400 pixels Component faces \u00b6 After determining the default front, the possible faces, in relation to the default front, are: 1. Default Front 2. Left 3. Top 7. Back 8. Right 9. Bottom Naming convention for URL \u00b6 Please follow this naming convention: - component identifier - underscore _ - type of image ( photographic or rendered ) - underscore _ - component face ( 1 : Default front, 2 : Left, 3 : Top, 7 : Back, 8 : Right, 9 : Bottom) - orientation ( C : Centre, L : left, R : right, N : No plunge angle) Example : An image for a component that is rendered with a default front facing image and centred orientation. identifier123_rendered_1C.jpg","title":"Components"},{"location":"3_Data_Specification/3_3_Components/#components","text":"The components schema contains information regarding the individual components that are used to create complete packages.

Height: millimetre (mm) Width: millimetre (mm) Length: millimetre (mm) Volume: cubic metre (m3) Weight: grams (g) servingCapacity: grams (g) Numbers should be entered with a decimal place, a space between the number, and the unit as specified above. Use the decimal / full stop / period character as a separator. For example: volume = 20.000 mm3. Do not exceed 3 decimal places. Important : When converting between systems of measurement, perform the conversion first and then apply rounding. This will give more accuracy and consistency. Default Front of a complete packaging \u00b6 As with taking and reporting measurements for components, we use the GS1 method for taking measurements. Now, with all the components put together to form the complete packaging, first find the default front, the the face with the largest area, where area is equal to the width times the height. The side with the maximum area then becomes the default front of that complete packaging. Measuring the height, width, and depth of a complete packaging \u00b6 After the default front has been determined, it is possible to determine the height, width, and depth of the complete packaging. Please follow the measurement guidelines provided by GS1 Guide for complete packaging images \u00b6 As with providing measurements, please first find the default front of the complete packaging.
