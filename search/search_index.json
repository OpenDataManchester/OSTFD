In a supply chain, different companies and people work together to get products from where they\u2019re made to where they\u2019re sold.</p> <p>There are various steps in the supply chain:</p> <ul> <li>Getting Materials: It starts with getting the materials needed to make something, like a car or a phone. These materials might come from different places around the world.</li> <li>Making Stuff: Then, companies use those materials to make the actual product. For example, a car company takes metal, plastic, and other parts to build cars.</li> <li>Moving Things Around: Once the product is made, it needs to get to the stores or customers who want to buy it. This involves shipping and transportation, which can involve trucks, ships, planes, and more.</li> <li>Selling and Supporting: Finally, the product gets to the stores or customers, who buy it. But the process doesn\u2019t end there. Companies often provide support, like customer service or repairs, to make sure customers are happy with their purchase.</li> </ul> <p>Key componets of an efficient and effective supply chain are:</p> <ul> <li>Collaboration: Different companies and people along the supply chain need to work together smoothly. If one part of the chain breaks down, it can slow everything down. For example, if a supplier can\u2019t deliver materials on time, it can delay production.</li> <li>Interoperability: This means making sure all the different parts of the supply chain can work together seamlessly. For example, the computer systems used by suppliers should be able to communicate with the systems used by manufacturers and retailers. If they can\u2019t, it can cause errors and delays.</li> </ul> <p>Throughout this supply chain, collaboration and interoperability are essential to ensure that various materials are sourced sustainably, manufactured efficiently.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/key-concepts/#supply-chain-products-waste-flows","title":"Supply Chain, Products, Waste Flows","text":"<p>The diagram below can help you to visualise how information might flow across the apparel supply chain. <pre><code>sequenceDiagram\n    participant manufacturers\n    participant brands\n    participant retailers\n    participant consumers\n    participant recyclers\n    participant complianceSchemes \n    participant regulators\n    manufacturers-&gt;&gt;brands: products\n    manufacturers-&gt;&gt;retailers: products\n    manufacturers-&gt;&gt;complianceSchemes: data\n    manufacturers-&gt;&gt;regulators: data\n    brands-&gt;&gt;retailers: products\n    brands-&gt;&gt;consumers: products\n    brands-&gt;&gt;recyclers: waste\n    brands-&gt;&gt;complianceSchemes: data\n    brands-&gt;&gt;regulators: data\n    retailers-&gt;&gt;consumers: products\n    retailers-&gt;&gt;recyclers: waste\n    retailers-&gt;&gt;complianceSchemes: data\n    retailers-&gt;&gt;regulators: data\n    consumers-&gt;&gt;recyclers: waste\n    recyclers-&gt;&gt;manufacturers: material\n    complianceSchemes-&gt;&gt;regulators: data</code></pre> The diagram hows the complexity of the apparel supply chain.

This includes information such as names, addresses, dates, product codes, and financial transactions.</li> <li>Syntax and Encoding: Standards may also define the syntax and encoding used to represent data, such as XML (eXtensible Markup Language), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), or EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). These specifications determine how data is packaged and transmitted between systems.</li> <li>Protocols and Communication: Exchange data standards often include protocols or communication guidelines for transmitting data over networks or communication channels. This can include protocols for data validation, error handling, security, and authentication.</li> <li>Industry Specificity: Many exchange data standards are tailored to specific industries or domains, such as healthcare, finance, retail, or manufacturing.
