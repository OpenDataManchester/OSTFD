It has been developed as part of the Plastics Packaging Portals (PPP) Project, an Innovate UK supported project under the Smart Sustainable Plastic Packaging (SSPP) Fund. The project is led by OPRL alongside project partners Open Data Manchester, Dsposal, RECOUP, and Ecosurety.</p> <p>The project brings together stakeholders from the entire plastic packaging ecosystem to explore how we might create the foundations for systemic change  in the packaging value chain. We have had more than 80 individuals from over 40 organisations take part in our workshops, interviews and research and we are incredibly grateful to them for sharing their time, expertise and support. </p> <p>PPP has 5 main aims which will be delivered by 30th November 2022:</p> <ol> <li>Extend the Open3R Household Waste Recycling Centre (HWRCs) data standard</li> <li>Develop a prototype portal to capture data on geographically located recycling services such as HWRCs, bring banks, instore take back schemes to support a comprehensive open database of this information</li> <li>Develop an open standard for plastic packaging data (Open3P)</li> <li>Develop a prototype portal to capture packaging attribute data to enable it to be shared along the plastic packaging value chain and reported on</li> <li>Determine a sustainable business model and governance structure</li> </ol> <p>Although this funding and this phase of the project is focussed on plastic packaging, which is what Open3P covers currently, there is a commitment and desire to extend it to cover all types of packaging.</p> <p>By improving the data quality, granularity and availability of both packaging data and recycling services data and by enabling these datasets to be linked we believe we can support more sustainable packaging choices. By giving stakeholders visibility of the different parts of the chain we can help designers and manufacturers consider the end-of-life implications of their choices and we can help them determine the difference between a material being technically  recyclable and the practicality of it being recycled. Providing recyclers and reprocessors with detailed data about material types and recycling disruptors we can enable more materials to be kept at a higher value for longer. Improving these datasets also helps deliver better information into the hands of consumers to support them to recycle more. Better data on market trends in packaging can also provide more certainty and unlock investment and innovation so that we can increase our recycling infrastructure and ensure more of our waste packaging ends up recycled.</p> <p>The standard is being developed according to the OpenStand principles of:</p> <ul> <li>Due process</li> <li>Broad consensus</li> <li>Transparency</li> <li>Balance</li> <li>Openness</li> </ul>"},{"location":"1_Start_Here/1_1_Introduction/#what-is-an-open-data-standard","title":"What is an open data standard?","text":"<p>An open data standard is a set of rules that describe the structure and components of a dataset.

This tells the story of how water bottles are created with a packaging manufacturer, how that packaging manufacturer sends their packaging to a packer/filler (Figure 1), and then how that packer/filler will put packaging together, filled with a product and then send them to a retailer (Figure 2). In both figures:  - black represents the component catalogue items used to create complete packaging - orange represents the complete packaging items used to create multipacks - green represents the component catalogue, multipack, or complete packaging items used to create the load catalogue item - yellow represents the load catalogue item made to create a load</p> <p> Figure 1: From a packaging manufacturer to a packer/filler</p> <p>Above in Figure 1, we show the creation of water bottle components. After creating the water bottle components (the plastic bottle, two different types of lids, and a label), a packaging manufacturer would then use boxes (in this diagram it is one box size with the same materials) and a pallet to send their water bottle components to a packer/filler. The water bottle components, placed in the boxes on a pallet would create a load catalogue. This load catalogue would then be used to send to a specific packer/filler during a specific time period. The use of the component catalogue and load catalogue simplifies data entry by pulling data that has already been entered. Only the load would need to be updated based on reporting periods to estimate how many times a specific packer/filler recieved the load catalogue.</p> <p>Another packaging manufacturer would then separately create the plastic rings and use boxes and a pallet that they consistently send to the specific packer/filler. They would also update how many times during a certain time period that they sent these plastic rings to the (single) packer/filler. According to this image, these plastic rings use the same boxes and pallet (sizes and materials) to create the load catalogue for sending the packaging items to the packer/filler. As with the water bottle packaging manufacturer, the load would be updated based on reporting periods to gain an estimate of how much plastic rings are being sent to an area.</p> <p> Figure 2: From a packer/filler to a retailer</p> <p>Instead of re-entering data, a packer/filler would pull the data from the packaging manufacturer for the water bottle components. Using the component catalogue, the packer/filler could create two different types of water bottles (with the two different kinds of lids). The packer/filler uses the components to create the two different complete packaging, sealed bottles with lids, which is filled with the product (in this case, water). Notice that even though the plastic ring is alone in complete packaging. The reason for this is to fill in data related to this component, even though alone. For instance, the level of packaging (primary, secondary, shipment, transit) relies on how the complete packaging is filled and used, which is contained in the complete packaging csv. </p> <p>In addition to creating single purchase water bottle items, the packer/filler can use the same created water bottles, along with the plastic ring to create a multipack. Notice how the first type of lid is used solely for creating a multipack, and the second type of lid is used to create an individual unit. The individual use bottles along with the multipack can be combined onto a mixed pallet with boxes to create a load catalogue. As with the packaging manufacturer, the packer/filler can use the commonly created load catalogue items to send to multiple retail stores. They would then update how many times they sent the load to the retailer during certain reporting periods. </p>"},{"location":"1_Start_Here/1_4_Data_Schema/","title":"Data Schema","text":""},{"location":"2_Data_Formats/2_1_Data_Formats/","title":"Data Formats","text":"<p>When publishing Plastic Packaging Portal data, the csv format should be used. csv files can be created and edited in text editors, as well as spreadsheet packages such as Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, or Open Office.</p> <p>Template csv files will be provided for publishers to populate.
