# Introduction

## What is the Open3P?

Open3P describes information about the use of plastic packaging in the supply chain. ###@sophie is there some better text we can put in here?###

The standard is being developed according to the [OpenStand](https://open-stand.org/) principles of:

* Due process
* Broad consensus
* Transparency
* Balance
* Openness

## What is an open data standard?

An open data standard is a set of rules that describe the structure and components of an open dataset. Putting rules in place means people and organisations that publish data about the same thing can use the same language to talk about it. Having a standard makes it a lot easier to understand and reuse data that has been published. It is especially useful if data is being published by lots of different people to make an even bigger dataset. Anyone can then read about the standard, contribute data, or use the data knowing everyone is talking about the same thing.

## How is the standard being developed?

The initial standard development was funded by [Innovate UK](https://www.opendatamanchester.org.uk/plastics-packaging-portal/), and is being developed through workshops with industry experts over a number of iterations.

## How to use the standard

The documentation here details how to *publish* data to the standard, and how to use data that has been published to the standard. At this stage, the expectation is that data management will be supported by additional applications, but it is possible to record and publish data to the standard using the provided csv files in [Section 8]() of this documentation.
