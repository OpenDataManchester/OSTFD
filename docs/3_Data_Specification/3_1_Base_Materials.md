# Base Materials

The base materials schema contains information regarding the materials at the very start of the process of creating packaging. These are then combined together within the materials table to create more complicated materials.

!!! question "Frequently Asked Question"

    Do all packaging items need to contain a `Base Material`?  
    Yes, every packaging item must include a Base Material. This foundational component serves as the building block for all packaging materials. The level of detail in specifying base material(s) can vary based on requirements. For more in-depth insights, refer to the Data Flow section.

## Table
|Column|<div style="width:90px">Status</div>|Format|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|identifier|`mandatory`|UUID|A globally unique identifier. See [identifiers](../4_Identifiers/4_1_Identifiers.md) section for information on how to construct this identifier.|
|name|`mandatory`|String|The name of the base material this row relates to. `e.g., Polypropylene or Aluminium or Silica`.|
|type|`optional`|String|Is the base material 'synthetic' or 'biobased'? Use the identifier of the material type that this row relates to. The entry here should be drawn from the [Material Type Controlled List](../5_Controlled_Lists/5_001_Material_Type.md).|
|materialChemCID|`optional`|String|The PubChem CID for the exact base material used. The PubChem CID is PubChem's compound identifier, which is a non-zero integer for a unique chemical structure. PubChem CID can be found using their [search](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=_blank}. If for some reason the PubChem CID cannot be located, consider contributing to PubChem and create the compound identifier. However, if this cannot be done, please enter `Unknown`.|
|externalIdentifiers|`optional`|Dictionary|A dictionary of identifiers that might be used to identify the base material in other systems. For example: manufacturer's own internal identifier, bar codes or global trade item number (gtin). To provide external identifiers please follow this format. `{'externalIdentifierName1': 'identifier1', 'externalIdentifierName2': 'identifier2'}`|
|certification|`optional`|Boolean|Does the base material have a certificate (e.g. FSC, REACH, FSA etc.)? Answer as: `TRUE` for yes and `FALSE` for no.|
|certificationClaims|`optional`|List|The information regarding the certification. The entries should be the [Certification Claims Relationship List](../6_Relationship_Lists/6_005_Certification_Claims.md) identifiers.|
|manufacturers|`optional`|List|The information regarding the manufacturer(s). The entries should be the [Organisations Relationship List](../6_Relationship_Lists/6_010_Organisations.md) identifiers.|
|manufacturedCountry|`optional`|String|The country the component was manufactured in. Use the country numeric [ISO codes](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search){target=_blank} as described in the [ISO 3166 international standard](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html){target=_blank}.|
|updateDate|`mandatory`|Date|The date that the base material was provided/last updated. Use the format `yyyy-mm-dd` adhering to the [ISO 8601 dateTime standard](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html){target=_blank}.|
