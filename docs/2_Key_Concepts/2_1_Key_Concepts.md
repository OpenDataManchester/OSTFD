# Key Concepts

## Components
- an individual unit
- zippers, taps, etc. (even though attached)
- things used to tie components together 

## Component Catalogue
- general template used for packaging manufacturers to store information. 
- these components can be used by multiple users and combined with other components in different ways

## Unique Components
- a unique component is a component that takes information from the component catalogue, and has additional data added to it
- unique components are tangible components, ie physical objects that have a presence in the real world (as opposed to components from the catalogue, which are data about a hypothetical thing) 

## Complete Packaging
- Unique components are combined to make complete packaging
- for example, a lid, a bottle and a label are all unique components. These would be combined to form a complete packaging item

## Multipack
- Sometimes, multiple units of complete packaing are combined, and sold as a single unit
- This is a multipack

## Load
- Complete packaging units are combined into a delivery load
- Usually wrapped in secondary and tertiary packaging 

## Product
- That which is contained inside of the packaging
