# Controlled Lists

Controlled lists are possible options in certain fields of the dataset. These are items that are maintained by a custodian of the data, and may be a list of local authorities, the services that are offered by HWRCs, or even days of the week.

It is important that these controlled lists are adhered to. Software developers building applications or services around this standard will rely on these options. Some software developers at the publishing end may introduce validation of the data to ensure compliance with these controlled lists.
