# Component Catalogue

Controlled lists are possible options in certain fields of the dataset. These are items that are maintained by a custodian of the data.

It is important that these controlled lists are adhered to. Software developers building applications or services around this standard will rely on these options. Some software developers at the publishing end may introduce validation of the data to ensure compliance with these controlled lists.

**Note:** Please use the controlled list that is tied to each a specific dataset. For instance, there are recycling disruptor controlled lists for the `Component Catalogue`, and `Complete Packaging` that will have unique identifiers and items specific to the context.

The controlled lists in use in the standard for component catalogue are:

* Shape
* Function
* Flexibility
* Component Catalogue Recycling Disruptors
* Opacity
* Level
* Reuse System
* Recycled Content Evidence Type
