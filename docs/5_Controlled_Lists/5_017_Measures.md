**Controlled lists are maintained by the SCB, if there are values that you believe need to be added then [contact us](https://www.open3p.org/contact/) and we can add new values to the lists.**

## Data
|<div style="width:200px">identifier</div>|category|unit of measure|description|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|measure-0001|mass|grams (g)|The mass of the item. Where mass is a fundamental property of an item that represents the amount of matter it contains. Provide in grams (g).|
|measure-0002|height|millimetres (mm)|The height of the item.|
|measure-0003|width|millimetres (mm)|The width of the item.|
|measure-0004|depth|millimetres (mm)|The width of the item.|
|measure-0005|volume|cubic centimetres (cm<sup>3</sup>)|The volume of the item.|
|measure-0006|density|grams per cubic centimetre (g/ cm<sup>3</sup>)|The density of the item. Where density is the mass of a unit volume of a material substance.|
|measure-0007|thickness|micrometres (μm)|The thickness of the item. Where thickness is the distance from one side of the item to the opposite side.|
|measure-0008|area density|grams per square metre (g/ m<sup>2</sup>)|The area density of the item. Where area density is the measure of how much mass is packed into a given area of a two-dimensional item.|
|measure-0009|yield|square metres per kilogram (m<sup>2</sup>/ kg)|The yield of the item. Where yield is a measure of the item’s coverage per unit of mass.|
