# Component Disruptors

The component disruptors controlled list identifies what might cause disruption during the end of life process of a component. This is used in [component end of life routes relationship list](../6_Relationship_Lists/6_007_Component_End_of_Life_Routes.md).

**Controlled lists are maintained by the SCB, if there are values that you believe need to be added then [contact us](https://www.open3p.org/contact/) and we can add new values to the lists.**
