# Certification Source

The certification source controlled list identifies the source of the certification document. This is used in [certification claims relationship list](../6_Relationship_Lists/6_005_Certification_Claims.md).

**Controlled lists are maintained by the SCB, if there are values that you believe need to be added then [contact us](https://www.open3p.org/contact/) and we can add new values to the lists.**
