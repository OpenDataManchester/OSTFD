# Shape

The shape controlled list identifies the shape in [components](../3_Data_Specification/3_3_Components.md).

**Controlled lists are maintained by the SCB, if there are values that you believe need to be added then [contact us](https://www.open3p.org/contact/) and we can add new values to the lists.**
