# Open 3P - The open standard for the packaging value chain

[![Open Data Manchester](img/Open_3P_banner_compress.png)](https://open3p.org){target=_blank}

The Open 3P standard for packaging data has been created to provide information about what packaging is made out of and how these materials flow through the packaging supply chain. With Open 3P, stakeholders in the packaging supply chain will be able to share information about materials, components and packaging in a standardised format. This will allow for better collaboration between manufacturers, brands, retailers, consumers, recyclers, compliance schemes and regulators.

## Version

Version 2.1 UNRELEASED
