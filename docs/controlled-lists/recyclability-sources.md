# Recyclability Source

The recyclability source controlled list identifies the source of the recyclability evidence. This is used in [recyclability claims relationship list](../relationship-lists/recyclability-claims.md).

**Controlled lists are maintained by the SCB, if there are values that you believe need to be added then [contact us](https://www.open3p.org/contact/) and we can add new values to the lists.**
