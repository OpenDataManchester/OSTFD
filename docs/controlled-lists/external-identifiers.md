# External Identifiers

The external identifiers controlled list identifies the **some** of the frequently used external identifiers used within OSTFD.

!!! note "Suggested controlled list"

    The external identifiers list differs from other controlled lists as it is "suggested," implying that the values provided represent commonly utilised options, rather than a comprehensive list. Originating from the [Schema.org product](https://schema.org/Product) page, this list aims to introduce a level of standardisation for external identifiers. It's important to note that while this list promotes uniformity, it is not all-encompassing. Additionally, the external identifier's name value should be entered as a text string and not as an OSTFD identifier. This approach allows for flexibility while encouraging consistency where possible.

**Controlled lists are maintained by the SCB, if there are values that you believe need to be added then [contact us](https://www.open3p.org/contact/) and we can add new values to the lists.**
