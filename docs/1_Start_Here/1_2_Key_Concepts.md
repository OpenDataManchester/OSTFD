# Key Concepts

## Material Catalogue
- general template used to store information about a base level material

## Materials
- an individual substance (e.g., PET)
- created from the material catalogue

## Components
- an individual unit (e.g., a bottle)
- parts made from different materials (e.g., a window on a sandwich box)
- zippers, taps, etc. (even though attached)

## Product
- That which is contained inside of the packaging

## Component Catalogue
- general template used for packaging manufacturers to store information. 
- these components can be used by multiple users and combined with other components in different ways

## Complete Packaging
- Components are combined to make complete packaging
- for example, a lid, a bottle and a label are all individual components. These would be combined to form a complete packaging item

## Multipack
- Sometimes, multiple units of complete packaging are combined, and sold as a single unit
- This is a multipack

## Load Catalogue
- Complete packaging units are combined into a delivery load
- Usually wrapped in secondary and tertiary packaging 

## Load
- Collection of load catalogue broken into destinations and on-the-market packaging for specified reporting periods.

## Packaging Item
- A component, complete packaging, or multipack 

## Reuse
- The packaging item remains as created and is repurposed without reconstruction

## Recycle
- The packaging item is broken down and created into something new
