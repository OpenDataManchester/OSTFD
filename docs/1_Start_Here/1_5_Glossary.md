# Glossary

## API
- An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In other words, it defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs enable developers to create software components that can interact and integrate seamlessly with other systems, services, or platforms.
