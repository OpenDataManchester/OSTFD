# Introduction

## What is OSTFD?

OSTFD is an open standard for textiles and fashion data for the apparel industries, which is being developed by Open Data Manchester. The goal of OSTFD is to establish a common language for exchanging and sharing data related to textiles and fashion materials, which will help to improve transparency and accountability in the industry.

With OSTFD, stakeholders in the textiles and fashion supply chain will be able to share information about materials, components and garments in a standardised format. This will allow for better collaboration between manufacturers, retailers, recyclers, regulators, and consumers. By creating a common understanding of the materials and processes involved in textiles and fashion, it will be easier to identify opportunities for reducing waste, increasing efficiency, and improving sustainability throughout the supply chain.

OSTFD is based on the principles of open data, which means that it is freely accessible, sharable, and usable by anyone. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts and use cases, so that it can evolve over time as new technologies and practices emerge. The development of OSTFD is guided by the [OpenStand](https://open-stand.org/){target=_blank} principles of:

* Due process
* Broad consensus
* Transparency
* Balance
* Openness

which ensure that the standard is developed in a fair and inclusive manner, and that all stakeholders have a voice in the process.

Overall, OSTFD represents an important step forward for the apparel industries, as it provides a foundation for greater transparency and collaboration across the supply chain. By adopting a common language for sharing and exchanging data, stakeholders will be able to work together more effectively to reduce waste, improve sustainability, and create a more circular economy.

## How to use the standard

To use the OSTFD standard, start by familiarising yourself with the terms and definitions outlined in the standard. These are used to describe the structure and components of garments and the textiles and fashion supply chain. Next, map your data to the standard by using the terms and definitions as a guide. This will ensure that your data is consistent and can be easily shared and understood by others who are also using the standard.

It's important to note that the OSTFD standard is not a technology or platform, but rather a set of rules and guidelines for how to structure data related to textiles and fashion. It is used to help people create technology, applications, and integrations that can work together to improve transparency and sustainability in the apparel industries. By using the OSTFD standard, you can ensure that your data is accurate, consistent, and interoperable with other systems that also use the standard.
